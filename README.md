# Jenkins Installation
Installation of Java
Jenkins requires Java to run, yet not all Linux distributions include Java by default. Additionally, not all Java versions are compatible with Jenkins.

There are multiple Java implementations which you can use. OpenJDK is the most popular one at the moment, we will use it in this guide.

Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 17, and check the installation with the commands:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre

java -version
